D So. How's your products been? <Laughter> I hear that one. Have you had any lately go out? F Oh, wow. C So you didn't get anything, even, all the, all the warranties were out? <Laughter> You're kidding. Yeah, we just moved into a new house, too, C so we had to buy all those, too. <Laughter> Yeah, the only thing I've had problems with is, F um, I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail C and I bought this paint stripper where they advertise <throat_clearing> that it's nontoxic and such, C and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings. C So. I didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than, I just ended up using it. C But, that's about the only thing I've had gone wrong. C But. That's incredible. <Laughter>. C And they all went out at the same time? C Or two days. Wow. <Laughter>. Wow, it's frustrating. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, they go out a lot? Yeah. D See I'm in the manufacturing home from work C and make, F um, automotive air bags, the safety air bags. Yeah. At Morton International, C and, I thin, D well, it's, it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment. We test everything after each assembly process, C and so our testing is pretty thorough, C but. F Um. F Um, the tests that, D well, we test every one electrically. We don't, I think they test four or five a day, actually exploding the air bags C and, C but we do test after, during the assembly project, product, F um, after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag, we check to make sure it's there after we install it, C so, each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done, C and then we do electrical tests on them during the process, C so. <Laughter> Yeah. D Well, they do the, all the testing that we have to do through the government, it's incredible how much testing they have to do. Uhhuh. F Um, I really haven't had, F uh, too many problems. F Uh, seems to me that everything that I buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out. Yeah, I've had a dryer, an ice maker, a microwave, all three, C and they, unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time, when I bought my new house, C and, F uh, I really don't have any recourse, C so I had to call and have them all repaired and that. Yeah, it was a hassle. Yeah, the warranty on the refrigerator, F uh, the i, the refrigerator warranty's still good, C but the ice maker itself, passed it's three years, C and it was three years and two months. No. F Uh, watch out. Uhhuh. F Um. I usually have pretty good luck with appliances, C but I just, F uh, it was within two days that all three of these stopped working, C and the the ice maker was, F uh, had to have a new pump, C and the, F uh, microwave had to have, F uh, some kind of something I can't even pronounce, C and they, F uh, the dryer had to have a new heating element, C so it was about, almost three hundred dollars for all three of them. F Uh, within two days of each other. I was, it wasn't a good week. I was pretty mad. C And C plus the place that I'd bought them all had gone out of business, C so even if I, I think even if I had, F uh, had kept the warranty, the service agreements were with the companies that, that manufactured, C but still they were through that retailer, C so I don't know if I could have taken it to another retailer or not. C But I didn't have to worry about all that, because they weren't under warranty. C So. It was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all, C but, I, the only other things that I've ever had trouble with, F uh, I seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers, blow dryers. Yeah, I've had two or three of those go out. One was under warranty, C and the other two weren't, C but, I just, other than that, D you know, T V s and things like that, I haven't ever had any trouble with. I don't think products are getting much better though. F Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you, do you test each individual one C or do you just test, D like if you've got ten, you test one, C and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay? Uhhuh. D Well, that's something I've never had to use, it's never, I've never been involved in an automobile accident, C so, luckily that's a product that I haven't had to test. C But I think it's a great idea. I'm, I'm, seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about C but that. F Oh, I'm sure they want to be thorough before they. C But, F uh, even, D you know, I don't mind spending the extra money on the car if, D you know, even if they pass the savings, the cost onto the consumer, because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing. I'm not a real big seat belt, my, F uh,
