There we go. F Uh, D so, F uh, what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary? That week, right. F Um. D Well, F uh, I, right now I'm in sort of a weird situation. I'm a graduate student that, F uh I don't have that many benefits per se <laughter>. F Uh, sort of get, Yeah, yeah. My wife has a real job C and I can see from her angle. F Uh, F uh, I think health insurance is real, real important. I've, I've, I've, I've discovered. E I mean, even in my case it's sort of, they're really, F uh, a pain in the neck about it up here C because the university makes me buy a small, they, they have a mandatory, they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance they offer insurance to everyone, C but then the basics that are major medical, they, they force you to buy here. D Now I'm covered by my wife's anyway, C but I still pay them a hundred dollars a semester for, F uh, mandatory. C So that's sort of annoying that I'm paying for something I'm not getting in that case. I'd rather that, that went to something else. Right. E I mean, F uh, C and, C and, C and it turns out that D actually, F uh, the benefits they, D you know, that, that hundred dollars sort of would, would entitle me to go to the university health services here, D you know, and, and use them C and it turns out that I do think they're v, they're excellent physicians there. C So, through my wife's H M O, we've registered for them as our primary care physicians C so we go there anyway, C so they're, they're, C so if they were to bill, which, which I believe they don't, C but if they were to bill the H M O for my business, they could, in, in theory, be getting paid twice for the same thing. C But they're not, thank God. F Uh, C but D anyway, F uh, otherwise, I would imagine, F uh, good vacation is, is important, although I don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job. I don't, D you know, F Oh, wow. C So that's really, Yeah. E I mean, I don't, D you know, I don't, I know my wife, F uh, I think she gets, D you know, about two weeks a year, I guess C but they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off. They, D you know, usually let her, Yeah. F Oh, really. Just, yeah. Yeah. That's, D well, that's a that's reasonable, I think. Yeah. Weigh all sorts of other things. Yeah, I think, I was watching something the other day about that D actually on, F uh, a news special or something like that C and they were saying how in some sense that, that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes, D you know, lowers the cost of everything and all insurance C and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people, D you know, don't get to, they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that C so, Uhhuh. Right. Least off, who decides. Right. Right. You want to know that, that, that when you pick a doctor, D you know, you, you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about. Yeah, that, that's the, Boy, I, I don't know. That's a, that's a, a tough one. F Uh, F uh, C and it's, F uh, I suppose it's, it's changes as, F uh, as percep, my perception changes of, of what, F uh, I'm getting gypped on C and <laughter> this week E or this month, F uh, F uh, F uh, we're just, F uh, going through, F uh, F uh, D well, there's a couple of changes to the, to the, F uh, our health plan C and, F uh, C and I guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance C but, F uh, If I step back I'm not sure I'd, I'd, F uh, say that. What, what about you? F Oh, okay. <Laughter> Yes, okay, C But, C but, on the other hand, one of these days you'll be out looking for a, Yeah. Yeah. Right, okay. C And, C and, yeah, C and the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars a semester, F uh, you, you never use because you just use your wife's. F Uh, yeah, I, it, F uh, the, the, that, that's a, a negative about, F uh, where, where I am in that, F uh, D well, I came out of, F uh, I worked five years civil service C and there it's, F uh, <noise> if I remember right, you D well, they, they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that and, or hours per pay period or something, C but, D anyway it works out as I remember basically to, F uh, you start at, at, F uh, two and a half weeks or something like that, C and it, at three years, F uh, it goes to four weeks I believe, C and I, I'm coming up on, I've been at T I now, F uh, F uh, coming up on fifteen years C and it, C and it just, F uh, this year is going to go to four weeks here C so, F Uh, F uh, Yeah, that's a, that, that is a, a, a negative, but, F uh, but, not, probably not at, probably not a deciding factor, C but, F uh, Yeah. D Well, that, that, yeah, that's, that's the thing is how, how flexible they are for comp time kinds of kinds of things C and, F uh, F uh, that's the, the, the, F uh, yeah. That's a, why it hasn't made all that much difference is because the, with the civil service, that you could take, you could take your vacation in increments of one hour C and, F uh, C and, C but, F uh, there wasn't, F uh, anything as far as comp time, C so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year, F uh, D you know, an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing. F Uh, whereas, F uh, here I, F uh, things are free enough to, that, F uh, the, the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that, isn't that much different, C but, F uh, C But, F uh, Yeah. I think the, I think the health insurance, I think that's, that's going through changes everywhere to, F uh, the, they've, F uh, F uh, gone through a couple years ago here where they, F uh, will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals C and now they're in the process of developing a list of, of, F uh, designated doctors, F uh, C so that just routine visits, F uh, they will compensate much better for, if you go to their designated doctors. Which, which, F uh, my assumption is that, that will not include my doctor since, F uh, he keeps real busy without having to, to, F uh, Yeah. D Well, C and, C and I think in the, in the, in the much bigger picture than, F uh, to some extent hospitals and doctors have some, F uh, fixed amount C and, if, if you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout to, to, F uh, F uh, give you, D you know, give you these rates and make this agreement then, F uh, you're not covered by that, C and, C and the added costs get passed on to you, C so F uh, I'm not, I'm not sure, it, my, F uh, one of the phrases I use is that, that it's moving towards, F uh, private socialized medicine. That, F uh, in terms of the negatives of, of always heard in terms of socialized medicine, you have no choice on who you, who you go to for a doctor and things like that, F uh, where it's the government that decides, here it's, it's, F uh, Yeah, F uh, C and, C but it, C but it's the, the same, the effect is the same as the, you, you, F uh, get left out of the loop more. I, I, I know that their, F uh, idea is that, F uh, if, if you have to pay a bigger share, you'll, you'll be more careful about spending the, spending the money and, and helping hold down the costs C but, F uh, I, I, I don't know, in terms of, in terms of, F uh, the health care, I, F uh, find that, that, F uh, although I've, I've been lucky enough to never have any big problems, C but that, that, F uh, the cost is not a, a big factor. I want to, I want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me get better. Yeah. Yeah C and,
