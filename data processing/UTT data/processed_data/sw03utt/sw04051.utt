Okay, you want to start? Uhhuh. Yeah, that's stuff we never even thought about three years ago. F Um. Have they stopped that practice now? <Throat_clearing> Yeah. <Throat_clearing>. <Throat_clearing>. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>, yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. F Um, yeah, yeah, I hate to see a car going down the street, or even a truck or bus for that matter, that's putting out a lot of dark smoke, C and I know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars, C but that, that particular bothers me. Uhhuh. F Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, I see. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, I might as well. F Uh, one of the things I'm very concerned about the air pollution, is the, F uh, this, this, the ozone layer, F uh, F uh, issue. F Uh, I used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of fre, different types of freons, C and that, F uh, rather bothers me that, F uh, I was in, in effect, F uh, contributing to the delinquency of the, the environment, so to speak. Right, right, C and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven, twelve and thirteen, in, in, in that area was because they were inexpensive, F uh, they could be made, F uh, D you know, inexpensive and lots of it, F uh, C and in that, and its properties were great, F uh, with, F uh, the machinery, didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to, F uh, get your heating and cooling cycles to work. C So. D Well, course there's a, a <laughter> tremendous number of refrigerators and fre, E excuse me, refrigerators and freezers, both commercial and residential, F uh, utilizing freon twelve, C and of course, the new cars, I guess starting with ni, nineteen ninetythree will not have freon twelve in their systems. C But, F uh, there's, D you know, the ton of after market machines, and et cetera, et cetera. C And that's got me very, D you know, highly concerned that, F uh, <breathing> that's going to be quite a while before we can, F uh, undo this. Now, that could spawn several good industries and help, pull us out of this recession, C but you got to have people that can make, D you know, earn a salary to pay for this conversion. C So, C so I see us in a kind, somewhat of a catch twentytwo unless we, unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and, and come up with a way to, F uh, have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting, F uh, compound. C Because as I say, there's a, there's a tremen, D well, how many, F uh, F uh, families own a refrigerator, C and then do, you know, that number, and then how many a, a freezer separate from and how many people, especially here in Texas, own cars and trucks with air conditioning. E I mean, this is, there, there are people that, that make it, have a thriving business, F uh, that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on, on automobiles and trucks, C and, F uh, the only reason I didn't, F uh, get into that more, when I was, had my little business, was because, F uh, most of your, F uh, air conditioning in, in, on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the Nth degree C and <laughter> E I mean, C so, F uh, <child> <cough> that's why I stayed in, stayed more towar, towards, F uh, F uh, C and that's a pollut, polluting type deal too, is the excessive, F um, D you know, F uh, petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth, and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with, with water and, F uh, <noise> <<sounds like knocking on a door>> really make, F uh, make a mess. Uhhuh. Right. D Well, most, most, most of the time when you see bus, F uh, D you know, the busses with the diesel that's, F uh, those are carbon particles, and carbon dioxide and water vapor, F uh, C because when you, when diesel is burned it's it, D you know diesel fuel is burned in a, in the diesel engine it's burned so completely, that you don't have any, F uh, nitrous oxides, F uh, or oxides of nitrogen, F uh, to, F uh, form because of, by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine, because diesel oil is, F uh, <laughter> is not very volatile. D You know, where gasoline, if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone. Diesel is going to be around, because it doesn't evaporate easily, C and it's got, D well, D you know, it's latent heat is high, C but it's slow burning at, at, F uh, normal pressures. That's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios as the, as the air is heated, D you know, by virtue of the compression process to D like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio C and so if the car sucks in, F uh, fifty degrees,
