All right, have you lived in this area long? Okay. Yeah, it, it, it's, it's a lot warmer, a lot drier too, because usually about this time of year, this, D you know, you see a little bit more rain. E I mean by, by mid February, E I mean, we start getting a lot of rain. C But it, Uhhuh. Yeah, unseasonable. I used to, my wife and I we used to live in San Antonio, couple years ago, C and it was, it was I remember the first day of Spring, it was so much ice that came down, later on that afte, that afternoon and evening, it was just, it was horrible. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, D well, F um, I don't know I, I guess I'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather. F Um, I, I like it warmer, E I mean I like it, D you know, I like it warm C but it doesn't really matter. E I mean, I'd, I would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly C but, F uh, D Well I spent three years in Germany, C so I'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway <laughter>. C But I got used to it, it was really strange, E I mean, when I, when, when, when we came to San Antonio it was just like, F uh, D you know, it just, just swelter C and then we got used to it C and then we went up to Dallas C and it was just, it's, it's not, not that it's just hot or dry, it's just not very comfortable, it just, Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. Yeah, <laughter> my wife and I, A the last day we were in Florida, we, my visiting my, F uh, my parents, and my brother and sister, we were, we were down there C and, the last day, right before we left, we had to, I had to ride with my sister C and the air conditioning went out on the car <laughter>, C and, we, you, you just get used to air conditioning all the time, C and this, it was just, the humidity was like eighty plus, eighty percent plus C and it was just killing us. Yeah. Yeah, D well, <throat_clearing> E I mean, I, I, I guess I've been in some places, D you know, where the weather was just so mild, D you know, places like Monterey, California or, D you know, just, D you know, so mild, C and then you've been to such extremes like San Angelo, Texas where you just, where you walk outside and you sweat, D you know you're sweating, you look down at your arm, C but you see the water leaving your arm, it's so hot, you just feel it pulling away, bizarre. Yeah. Yeah. I tend to agree C but, I don't know, I, I think, in, in some, in some respects it probably more tolerable. No, the other topics. I got one topic, they said talk about the Middle East situ, <talking> D well, D Well <laughter> E I mean I've had some pretty bad, I guess some pretty controversial topics C so it's just like D well that was my fault. C But then the weather's D like, man, E I mean, it gets pretty mundane, E I mean you can only talk about, about the situation just so long. Okay. Bye. No, I've only been here a couple of years. F Uh, C but, F uh, I've, I've noticed that, F uh, this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past. Yeah, yeah, D well I remember last year, E or the year before, F uh, we had ice and snow, F uh, F uh, terrible ice storm, F uh, around this time of the year. C And, F uh, this year it's been so hot and, F uh, sunny it, it's really quite, F uh, quite amazing. Uhhuh. F Um. Yes, I was just talking to my son today, he's up in Boston, C and it was twentynine there C and it was, D you know, in the seventies out here C and, it was really, F uh, he really wished he could be here, rather than there. F Oh really. Uhhuh, uhhuh. I have, D you know, I, I, don, I think it's really been delightful. I come, F uh, I've spent most of my time in, in warm weather areas C and, F uh, F uh, the ice and snow just doesn't, F uh, hold any allure for me at all. <Laughter>. Her, do you, you think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas. Uhhuh. You must, D well, F uh, it must be quite a bit hotter down there, isn't it? F Oh, wow. F Oh yes. F Oh yeah, it's terrible. Orlando is the only place I've ever been where I've seen the car sweat. E I mean, that's really bad. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh wow, F uh. I know I, I tend to, I tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate. F Uh it doesn't, some people say, F uh, they, they like to watch the changing of the seasons C but, F uh, I'd rather, D you know, like southern California, D you know, have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time. C So, it's kind of a luxury. Yeah, D well I guess this, the weather isn't as lively a topic as, F uh, as some of the others we might have gotten. <Laughter> I guess we're supposed to say goodbye or something, and think about what my daughter is here prodding me to say goodbye. We messed up the conversation, anyway. Yeah, I know, weather's just not all that inspiring. Okay, D well it's nice talking to you. Byebye.
