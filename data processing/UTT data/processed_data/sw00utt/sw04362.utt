<Clicking>. I don't know. F Uh, I haven't, it's been, F uh, D well seventynine since I was at school. At high school. C And, F uh, I've seen things change. I don't know if I've seen things change enough that I can actually, C because I wasn't really D like listening to the world go by back then C so it's hard to compare. You know what I mean? C But, F uh, it seems like when I li, I lived in Chicago, I, I've lived down here. I hear the dropout rates from the schools, C and I certainly see how much I pay in real estate taxes every year. C And I begin to wonder if I'm really getting my money's worth. E I mean, I, I've seen so many different things. So, so many different bad reports coming out of the school system C and I recognize that there are good schools out there. E I mean, somebody's getting, getting a good education because we, continue to employ people. C But, F uh, <swallowing> I don't, I don't understand the, F uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools don, seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. I don't know if I blame it on the school. I think, I think I blame it, I think I blame it on a couple of different things. I think I blame it on the school system. F Uh, Yeah. I don't blame it on the teachers in the school. I, although I think that, I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than, D well, <throat_clearing> they do quite well for themselves <laughter>. No. Not all school districts are well paid. C But there are some school districts out there that are very well paid. E I mean I know one family that's got, they're both teachers, C and they both have, D like second jobs that they work in the afternoons. They both work all summer fulltime. C And from their teaching job alone, they pull in forty grand each. I mean that family is making over a hundred grand. C And I'm, E I mean, okay, okay. Yes, I agree that teaching our kids is important. However, these people who only work eight hours day at it, from seven to three, C and they only work nine months a year C and they get an awful lot of breaks in between C and that's my tax dollars that I'm spending on that. C And I don't even have kids <laughter>. <Music> <TV> F Uh, D well, h, having sort of the reason we're going through the school system I seem to be younger than most people who, who talk on this thing. I'm, I'm just graduating col, graduating from college. F Uh, I didn't really perceive much of a, of a problem with the school system. However, when you compare it to school systems like they have in Japan and ad, you can compare just about everyth, thing to Japan < need to separate every th > C and we look like wh, we don't have anything. F Uh, it seems to be not difficult enough for students. Not challenging enough. And just not generally competitive enough. F Uh, however, I, if it weren't for our needless, F uh, <sigh> competition with Japan, I, I'd, I'd think that, that, the school systems, system works at a pretty good pace. Uhhuh. Right. <Rustling>. Yeah. F Huh. Right. <Clicking>. F Uh, D well, I don't pretend to understand that either. F Uh, C but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. C But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. F Uh, because the, the dropout rate is, in those areas, w, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and, and crime. C And they all seem to go together. C And it seems like if you could eliminate one <sniffing> of, of the parts of that circle, whether, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, D you know, general poverty kind of conditions, <sniffing> that things ought to get better. C So, F uh, a, the other two a, a, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways <sniffing>. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to, to fix C but it's just like, I, I don't expect them to know which, which, which part is best to fix just like I don't know. It's, it's a complicated issue. I, I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school. D Well, that's I meant when I said the school. F Huh. D Well, that's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school district, F uh, were well paid. <Rustling>. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, it, it, Right. <Noise>. Yeah, <laughter> D well that's true. C But tha, there's, you can always play games with, F uh, talking about, whoa, look at this. My tax dollars are paying for this. This is wrong. C But, when you're talk, w, w, C and there's really not much you can directly do about that. I think that, that if, if there is a problem with the school system, F uh, from, it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well, F uh, paid. That perhaps that might be one area that, that could be improved. F Uh, w, you have other professional jobs C and th, this is a profession. C And, as a matter of fact, it's a pretty big influence on, on <music> <TV>,
