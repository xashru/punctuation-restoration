<Hum> Okay. What is your, F uh, community, F uh, currently doing with regard to recycling? Uhhuh <swallowing>. <static> D Well that's more than we have up here in Massachusetts. Some, some local communities are very active in that, F uh, in that respect C and they do have bins set up. C But I live in a, a metropolitan area C and, F uh, they're not, F uh, too inclined to do something as aggressive as that <static>. Uhhuh. I, I know a lot, I think a lot of, F uh, the, the issues with regard to recycling are that, F uh, people have to be motivated to do, to do <clicking> something like that because it does take extra effort. Whether C and, C and I think that, C and I know Massachusetts has, a bottle bill was passed C and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now, C and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably, believe it or not, is just to get the extra nickel at the, F uh, the store and not, F uh, that's the majority of people that I know of anyways. Where people aren't really, D you know, eco conscious. It's just the fact that it's something they have to do. C And I'm not going to throw a bottle away, it's like throwing a nickel away. That type of thing. C But, F uh, people need to be more conscious of it. Yeah <whistling>. It didn't, it, it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans. F Uh, <whistling> C and, C and matter of fact, I think it took D like <bird_squawk> three tries t, for it to go through. C But, C and it's been pretty successful C and people notice it as far as, F uh, highways being, F uh, D you know, people would dr, have a drink of soda, instead of throwing out the window, they, they keep the bottle C so <children> it's, it's been a ecologically sound policy and, D you know, as, as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth. C But more importantly, it's recycling reusable materials back into, F uh, <swallowing> manufacturing. C And that's the big thing, I think, that th, they try to promote. Yeah, that's a good idea. Yeah. Th, there definitely has to be a motivation factor C and I know that, at w, where I work, I work for a defense contractor. C And there's a big push on for recycling, F uh, paper materials, D you know, computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of, F uh, Styrofoam usage because of the, F uh, <whistling> the process involved in Styrofoam and, and the whole eco issue and that. C And, C and they're very proactive C and, F uh, matter of fact, they give you discounts if you use, <whistling> F uh, china wear rather than, F uh, Styrofoam stuff, C so. C So, i, i, it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it. I think that's, that's what they need to do. Be more proactive like that. Yeah. They, they just, matter of fact, that, that reminded me of an article I saw in the pa, the local schools, you could send your phone book to your, F uh, to, with your kid to school C and what they'll do is they'll recycle it. C Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that, F uh, <baby_crying> trash, F uh, the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time. A guy went to a d, a landfill, dug down five feet and, and pulled up a phone book from D like nineteen sixty C because they don't, they don't degrade over such a period of time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay <hum> <children> <baby_crying>. F Uh, basically, they're just, F uh, having various recycling, F uh, bins, F uh, located for, F uh, trash pickup. D Well, here they and, F uh, live in an apartment complex. C And they only have one set of recycling bins, one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters. C So a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because, D you know, it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins. Right. They, Th, here they're trying to push through a bill C and a lot of people are against it. C And it's going to create a lot more work for the, F uh, the stores that sell, D you know, sodas and stuff. C Because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything. Right. I think here if they, F uh, instead of just, D you know, requiring that you put, put out the trash and stuff, if they could get some kind of rebate, those people who do put the stuff out, F uh, D you know, and separate it, have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate. F Uh, I know, F uh, I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books. F Uh, usually have them come from D you know, projects to collect old ones. Usually just get dumped out with the trash. C And phone books are a large volume of annual <laughter> trash. D Well, part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper. They contain the glue and stuff C and they used to have to take out all the, F uh, pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them. Now I think they've come up with some way of, F uh, pulling the glue out.
