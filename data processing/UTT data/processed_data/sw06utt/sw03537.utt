Okay, what do you think about, F uh, the self insurance business? Uhhuh. D Well, I, F uh, I understand what you're saying, C and there's probably some truth to that. I think that, F uh, generally I don't welcome added government responsibilities. However, when a, anybody can't police their own profession, it eventually leads to that, C and I think the costs and the, F uh, the way the medical profession has, every year I, being in my own business, F uh, in the last six years, every year there's been at least minimum twentyfive percent increase in health insurance costs, C and I think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance, as, as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter. F Uh, I think they're asking for it. I, I think the medical profession is just, just pushing until there's no option but the government take it over <<faint>> C and, F uh, D Well, I, I think a lot of it is, F uh, I, I don't disagree totally with that, C but, F uh, my wife this last summer, F uh, when we were on vacation tore up her knee, C and, F uh, F uh, it was lig, ligaments, F uh, in her knee, as it turned out, F uh, she came back that, F uh, we were out at Cape Hatteras when this happened C and, F uh, she got home, C and the leading orthopedic man, who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come, E I mean, he knows knee problems okay, E I mean if anyone does, this guy knows it. D Well, she goes in, he says, D well, I think this is what it is, C but, F uh, you better go to the hospital and have one of these M R I things. A thousand dollars for this, F uh, F oh, magnetic, F uh, resonance imaging type thing. C And my wife said, D well, do I need that? C And he says, D well, F uh, D you know, it, it'll help me diagnose this. E I mean, F uh, D you know, I, I suggest you go have this thing. Insurance won't pick this up unless you're in the hospital. D Now, a, thousand, F uh, F uh, dollars for thirtyfive minutes. E I mean, doctors routinely send people in for anything. D Now, for years they didn't have this C and they solved these problems, C and, D you know, I said to her, D well, look, D you know, if you feel you got to go, go, C but I, I think a thousand dollars, these guys, I don't know what it is, C but there's, no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day. C And even if they cost a hundred, two hundred, five hundred thousand dollars, at, F uh, roughly a thousand dollars every half hour, F uh, that's ridiculous. I, I don't care what anyone says. D You know, the costs are not, it's a picture. It shouldn't cost more than thirtyfive bucks for something like that, D you know, reasonableness. C But they aren't reasonable. Fifty, a hundred dollars. They don't have to pay them back in three months time. D You know. D Well, I think that should be, that, that's a, another problem, C but that's part of our legalese problem. C And that, the government eventually will address too <laughter> just, D you know, because it's out of control. I, I agree with you. D You know, F uh, I was on a jury E or I, I didn't make the jury, C but there was a, deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant. D Like it was three days after it was born, C and he was the one that delivered it. C And they got four attorneys, one guy out of Houston, he introduced himself as snake soandso, C and he says, D well, anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars, C and I says, yeah, I got problems with <laughter>. E I mean, <laughter> D you know, five million bucks isn't going to bring this kid back, D you know, E I mean, as sorrowful as it is. F Uh, D you know, if the doctor is wrong, D you know, he should be pulled from his license, C but five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it, D you know, it, it doesn't make logical sense to me, C but, F uh, F Uh, that's, D Well, I watched something on T V a couple of months ago by, F uh, General, ex, F uh, Surgeon General Koop. C And he talked about Canada's system C and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that, C but the expensive stuff, heart, F uh, operations and things, they have a managed scarcity. C And they said that in Canada, there were as many heart, F uh, trauma centers as there is in San Francisco. C So in one city of, in America, there's as many, F uh, hospitals that are equipped to do hosp, F uh, heart operations as in the entire area of Canada, C and that's kind of spooky. Uhhuh. Do you think that it's just, F uh, medical guys? What about, D you know, D you know how expensive new equipment and technology is. That's where I think most of the cost is coming. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, great. Yeah. Uhhuh. No. Yeah, I'll have to agree, with you there, C but there's another problem, C and that's the, how litigious our society is. If the doctor makes a mistake, he can be sure that he's going to be hauled into court. <Noise>. Uhhuh. No, it doesn't.
