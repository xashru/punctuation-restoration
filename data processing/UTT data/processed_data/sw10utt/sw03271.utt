Okay. What kind of pet do you have, Gail? F Oh, you have children <laughter>. Have you? F Uh, what have you had? Oh. D Well, you're going to have lots of pets with your children <laughter> growing up. <Laughter> D Well, we had a, a Schnauzer that we lost this summer, C and he was fourteen years old. C And, F uh, <lipsmack> we've had two Schnauzers C and before that we had all Dachshunds, C and I think my husband wants another Dachshund, C and we're trying to debate because our children are grown C and, C and, F uh, I don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a pe, D you know, another dog. C And we do have a very loving cat that's, D you know, kind of our baby. C And, F uh, C and we like pets. We like them around. We have grandchildren that run through C and they think we should have a dog, C and that's because they have a Great Dane <laughter>. They're just huge <laughter>. F Oh, yes, yes. Yes, I have never wanted to, that's why we've never gotten a female, D you know, in anything. C And, F uh, F uh, C and our male cats, D you know, we had, F uh, neutered right away, C and, of course, it, he doesn't know it. He's still out partying. C But, F um, D you know I do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and just had her, have her spayed, D you know. C And, F uh, Yes. Yes, yes. Which I think is a good thing. It just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved C and, D you know. It, F uh, C plus, F uh, you know the safety factor and stuff. D Well, we enjoy having pets. We, F uh, D you know, I think they're a lot of company, C and, C and when my mother lived with us, F uh, the cat was really hers C and, C and he was kind of wild. Our, our daughter found her and brought her to us, C and, F uh, that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap. C And she was the only one at first that, D you know, could really hold him, D you know, because he was really skittish. C But it was like he knew D you know, C and he would sleep with her, C and so he was a lot of company to her. D You know, and, and just love her. C And he's, cats are usually so independent C but this one D you know, he comes up C and he crawls up next to my husband now, D you know. He's, D you know, <laughter> before the dog died, we have a queen size bed and the dog would sleep on my side, C and the cat would sleep <laughter> on my husband's side, D you know <laughter>. C And when everybody turned we all four of us <laughter> turned in a row <laughter>. Uhhuh. Did he? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh, <<very faint>> uhhuh. I think that's one of the reasons our, because as I said our, our Schnauzer was old. C And so he was becoming incontinent. C And so then I would just have messes in the house, C and I think that's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with, D you know. C And, F uh, C and it was new carpeting C and, D you know, it jus, just really, <laughter> D you know, upset me no end. C And, F uh, Oh <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yes, you will. You will. D You know, we were trying to decide to, D you know, about putting him to sleep. He was just, D you know, he was getting so old and had a, other problems too. C And, C and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier. D You know, C and, C and again going through that because our, our animals are almost like our kids in some ways, D you know, C and, C and you grieve just as much over them when they go D you know, as you would a child. C And, C and, D you know, our son and, and his wife and our daughter and her husband and the grandkids all say, get a dog, get a dog, D you know. <Laughter> Little thing. Be quiet, be quiet. C And I can tell my husband, D you know, deep down he, D you know, he real, D Well, I don't. I have children <laughter>. I have little children. Both of my kids are under two so right now we don't have pets, C but we've had lots of them in the past. Uhhuh. D Well, we had a dog before we moved here. F Uh, C and we couldn't bring her with us. We came from Colorado, C and we've had hamsters and fish and birds. Okay, I've, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Baby_talking> Huh. Yes. Definitely. D Well, we, D you know, if it, F um, if it were just more peaceful, D you know, with the little ones, <baby_talking> we would definitely have a pet. I just think it's nice to have around. We had a cat that had kittens. C So any pet that I get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered. C Because, F uh, I did. That experience was awful <groan>. Uhhuh. <<Talks to baby very faint>> what you doing? Oh. D Well, a lot of times now when you buy them from D like the S P C A or from the humane societies or whatever, their adoption includes their spaying. C So, <Groan>. Uhhuh. Oh. <<Very faint>> uhhuh. Yeah. <Child>. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. My husband that's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us. Our dog wasn't interested in even coming in our room, C but our cat would sleep with us C and he hated that. Uhhuh. He just thought that they belong, C and when she'd walk on the couch along the back behind his head he hated that. C So, I guess it's probably, probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn't be a cat <baby_talking> even though I love cats. I think it would probably be a dog, <baby_talking> C and it would definitely be an outdoor animal. <Baby_talking>. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, that would, <lipsmack> Greg, F uh, my husband's grandparents have a dog C and they just, it needs to be put to sleep C but it's grandpa's dog, C and, F uh, he's really getting too old to take care of it. C But the dog messes all over the carpet C and my daughter is just nine months old C and so then she crawls on the carpet C and, F oh, the smell E I mean it's just really awful C and that's, that's one real drawback, C but D you know I guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough <laughter>. Uhhuh. <Laughter>.
