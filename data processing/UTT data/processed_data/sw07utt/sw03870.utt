Okay, Lee. Tell me about your ideas on this, F uh, the U S government supporting health insurance and so forth. D Well what is this going to do the insurance companies who are supporting this work now and hopefully are doing, F uh, a good job? Yes. D Well this is what's bothering me, Lee, another question, do you think that there should be some control, F uh, innovated such that the doctors are not allowed to charge ridiculously over priced things. We realize that for the individual person, some things are very important. F Uh, matter of fact, in some respects their life might depend on it. C But, by the same token some of these charges they make for D well, minor endeavors, A shall we say on the parts the doctors are really out of line. There should be some control of that. Yes C and that is what is giving the local, F uh, insurance companies hard times. That is the one thing we have no control over are these charges that happen when you go to hospitals C and you get something done C and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it. Yes. We have had several of them. My wife and I both have had that recently. Yeah. D See, that, that bothers me about the government D see, F uh, my, Do you think that that these insurance things should be covered on a State basis or U S government basis? D Well, I think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health care C and the reason is because the market place doesn't seem to have performed adequately, F uh, the invisible hand that which Adam Smith wrote has, F uh, provided some very good health care and, F uh, much, A I think inadequate health care. F Uh, C and in some cases, the absence of health care has resulted from market place forces C and I think, F uh, it's inevitable. It is just a matter of, F uh, time and mistakes <children> C and they're both inevitable. D Well, it's going to make it tough for them C and it's going to be a difficult transition. I don't know, F uh, how it's going to, F uh, play out in terms of the particulars, C but I don't think that society will be willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long. Our, F uh, physical and mental and spiritual health, F uh, it's really, F uh, very costly. C And, F uh, as a society <laughter> we are paying a staggering price for this. My, Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, there are abus, they're abusive of privileges <children>. Right. D Well, this I think is one of the things that national health care of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten, or twenty or thirty years will address. C Because I know this is, addressed by, F uh, in Canada. I, I have a good friend who is, F uh, a physician practicing in Canada. C And they made the transition, F uh, C and I think that the, F uh, for example the duplication of magnetic resonance imageries F uh, I've, I've had one myself C and, F uh, they're wonderful technology, C but cities have three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they need. C So, I think that what the market place doesn't do because of the way the system has worked C and it doesn't allocate resources oftenly because there is a tendency, F uh, at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills, C but it's begun to change all of that. The people paying the bills, F uh, employers ultimately, have begun to squawk because they have seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years. C So, I think the evolution will be interesting. F Uh, Hawaii has a system that is apparently working C and, F uh, it will be interesting to see how, how, F uh, much more attention we pay to that. <child> I do think though that it is inevitable primarily because of the pain, F uh, that people are feeling, F uh, under the circumstances. F Uh, I believe that it will contribute to something that we would at this point call national health care, whether it's subsidized by the government and and operated by private insurers, F uh, I don't know. I like that idea. I tend to be one of those people who believes the market place can under varied circumstances with the profit incentive work very very well. F Uh, I, we would be a lot better off if we, if we, contracted our national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity because we would probably have much less waste. D Well that's, that's the problem with government, F uh, administration of these programs <child> C and that is one of the things that we as society are going to have to deal with. Government is going to have to change in this regard. D You know, that is really a tough one for me to answer. I don't, F uh, I would like to see the greatest improvement in management. My, my, my field is the cognitive sciences C and I recognize that a lot of these things that are done, <child_whining> are done, F uh, as a function of the operating systems in place. C And those operating systems have to change C and C and as we become more efficient in developing machine operating systems we're going to develop more efficient human operating systems C and so a State or federal application, F uh, could work. F Uh, it all depends upon the way you structure the environment. We may have to deal with,
