Is, F uh, kind of fun. It's best done when you have leisure time C and I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now <breathing>. C And I grew up in an area that, F uh, was just a few feet from a rather large lake, and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake C and we had <noise> a variety of boats at our disposal <breathing>. F Uh, I worked for a camp for a number of years. My father was on staff there, C and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats, you name it, they had it C and we did a lot of watering, <breathing>, water sports. C But I think, F uh, <breathing> the thing I liked the best was, F uh, we spent about a summer <lipsmack> couple of guys, F uh, restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the midthirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real h, big old four foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves, C or the wind came from the side C and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it. If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up. It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, F uh, upright again. This one you had to work with. You <laughter> get out of the water again and get it upright. C And, F uh, sailing was, was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the, the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth C and, F uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day C and, F uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing C and as soon as the front came over, it was calm. So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle <breathing> C and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. C And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet, <breathing>. C But, F uh, it's, it's a nice, nice hobby to have. Nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time, nor do we live that close to a lake anymore, D so things change, I guess. What are your memories of boating, C or current, Right. That's true. Yeah, I remember learning how to ski, F oh, I guess I was seven or eight years old C and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to C and it was maybe fifteen, twenty acres C and it was, F uh <breathing>, it had a lot of, F uh, turtles in it. C And I got all ready to go C and I was down in the water and, and set to go C and, F uh, C and just as that boat took off, a turtle bit me in the middle of the back. It didn't hurt too much, C but it bit enough to where I let go. C And the boat went off without me C and I reached back there and s, pushed him away and got out of the water a, a while C and, C and, F uh, it didn't even leave a mark. It was just a little nibble C and so I told everybody what happened C and they go, F oh, yeah, sure, D you know. C And so I get back down in there C and, C and I'll be if he didn't do it again. This time a little earlier and, and I had let go before then and, before they took off this time and, and swatted him away. C So I moved over a, a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and, F uh, managed to get up. Didn't go very far, C but I got up. C And it, it was a nice, F uh, nice long skiing career, C but now I've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me. I've, I've, F uh, done about all I dare do on skis. D You know, skiing on one and jumping around here and there C and I, I, I know how you can get injured doing much more than that C and I just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that. Just, F uh, can't take the risk I did as a dumb teenager, I guess <breathing>. D So life just changes a little bit in that respect <breathing>. I'd kind of like, someday, to maybe end up on a pair of skis that, that doesn't have a, F uh, D well, what they call trick skis. They'll allow you to ski backwards. I haven't cr, managed to get a hold on that, F uh, craft yet, C but, F uh, Yeah, it, it would be kind of nice. I hadn't quite figured out, I don't have anybody to teach me either. That's another little thing. You need somebody to kind of tell you what to do, C but, just from what I've seen, you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick <breathing>, D you know. Grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you around. C But, F uh, I don't know, maybe someday I'll <lipsmack>, I'll get back to that as, after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end, weekend or something. F Uh, about the only memories that I have of boating, F uh, my husband's family had a, a motor boat, F uh, when we got engaged C and they took us out on the lake several times. C And, F uh, I really did enjoy that. I, I don't know that I ever learned to drive it or anything, C but, F uh, we did some water skiing, of course, and, and, F uh, driving around the lake in the boat and, and just the basic safety rules and things I found real interesting. F Uh, D you know, they, they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever. The, the laws were there C and if you didn't obey them, F uh D you know, <laughter> there were a lot of accidents, I guess. C But, F uh, I found the motor boating was real fun. Oh <breathing>. <Laughter>. That sounds like a real challenge. Uhhuh. D Well, my son,
