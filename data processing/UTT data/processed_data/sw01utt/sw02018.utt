Hello, Hello this is Lois. C And, F uh, I called D you know, from that, the, the T I Data Base Calling Instructions. Yeah, this is about changes in the women in the, F Uh, there's really a lot, isn't there. I think there really is. F Oh, I guess the work force would be the main, wouldn't it. Okay <tone>. All right. Are you ready now? Okay, like I said I guess it would be the work force, D you know, as far as changes in the generations. F Uh, no, I think no, now, you go to work when they're six weeks old, D you know, C and you stay there. C And I feel like the next generation, you'll probably just work right along with your husband, D you know. F Oh, I do to, much. C And it's just going to get better. It really is. F Oh, I can't either, not a one. Uhhuh. Yeah, even in Washington, D you know, there seems to be a lot more women involved. Yeah, yeah. F Oh, I do too, just your qualifications C and that would be it. Yeah, I kind of think, maybe in time, that, D you know, you'll go by social security numbers, D you know, C and that way they can't say D well they picked a male over a female, female over a male, D you know, Yeah, yeah. I do to just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that, D you know, that you have. C And then if you get it, D you know then, Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. As a matter of fact, that's what I'm doing. Uhhuh, it sure is. It sure is. Oh. Yeah, yeah that is. Uhhuh. F Oh, I do, I really do, I think it's great. F Uh, D well D like, one week she'll work three days and I'll work two C and the next week, D you know, I'll work three C and she'll work two, C and we just share off like that. Uhhuh, yeah we get the full benefits. C But we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under. Yeah. It really is, C and that way we're not really missing any thing out, D you know, of children, uhhuh. F Oh, it is, it is, D well both of ours is school age, C but we don't want to miss any of those P T A s and, D you know, all of that. Uhhuh. I think it's great, I really, C and I look for more of that in the next generation. Yes, F oh, I do too. Most of the time now, D you know, it's just the weekend, C or just forget it. Uhhuh. To do, yeah. Uhhuh. D Well I think we've really come a long way in that because, Uhhuh. Yeah, C but I can rem, remember back growing up, my mother, E I mean it was she always worked, C but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off. F Oh yeah. F Oh, I do too. Yes, yes. They really are. I know, <laughter> I know the feeling. Okay, I sure will. Byebye. Hello. Hi. Hi, hi, this is Lisa. Uhhuh. Yeah, I got a call yesterday too. This is a different subject though. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. It's kind of an easy thing to talk about. Yeah, F uh, I think you have to push one C and then we can start recording it. Okay. Yes. Yes, I know because, I know when my mother was a, D you know, going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her, I guess, she's in her late forties. You were expected to stay home and take care of the kids C and I've never faced that at all. Uhhuh. Yeah, uhhuh, I think it's definitely gotten better. Uhhuh. C Because women are in every field now, E I mean I can't think of a field that they're not involved in. C And I know at least in the medical field, it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field. I don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing. Yeah. Hopefully, the next generation, it won't even be an issue, E I mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman, I think that would be the best goal. Uhhuh, exactly, not what color you are, how old you are, what your male or female. That would be wonderful, I guess it's kind of an ideal world though, F huh <laughter>. Yeah. Exactly, or the way you look, or the way you, D you know, your age or anything. I think that would be a wonderful way to do it. Uhhuh, C and then, Uhhuh, also, with, F uh, women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as, D you know, what's it called, job sharing. D Like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job, or, Is it. That would be great. C Or, a lot of women I know now and my, F uh, one of my supervisors, when she went on L O A to have her baby, we hooked up, F uh, F uh, a terminal at her house and she, D you know, we could send her messages, C and, C and she kept in touch like that, and basically, just worked out of her house. I would just take her the actual paperwork once, F uh, every week or two, C and that worked out great too. C And that's a real attractive option, if you have the, the technology for it. All it was, was, D you know, E I mean, she just used a phone modem C and she was D like she was sitting in the office, C so I think that's real nice too, to come up with different options. Do you like the job sharing? Do you? Do you work like half days, or half weeks or, F Oh, F oh that's great, Uhhuh. Do you get the full benefits? F Oh, that's wonderful. Yeah, especially with children, and so many things going on, that would be great. Either way, yeah, you have your career and your home life, C and that would be a nice way, especially if you have young children. Uhhuh, F oh, no, I think, yeah. My son's just in daycare C but even that they have extracurricular activities C and the older they get the more that you're involved in that. Yeah, I do too, especially as women get up in management and, and can be in on those decision making, D you know, when that subject comes up they can say yes, that would be wonderful. Plus, I bet it cuts, cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two days off that you can do everything, C so you don't have to, D you know, unless you're just really sick, or the child's sick. Uhhuh, F oh yeah, I have to plan way in advance, because, C or, what I've done is found D like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours. That's been real helpful too, D like my doctor stays open til nine in the evening. C So that's real helpful, C so you don't, D you know, have to do it during office hours, run out on your lunch hour. I don't know how many times I've done that to do something, post office or the bank or any kind of errand, C so. Uhhuh, I guess I take it for granted, kind of, because, I just, it's always been that way. C But I know, F Oh no, I can remember my mother getting in trouble if, D you know, one of was sick, C and I know she probably didn't make hardly anything, D you know, compared to the work that she did. I think there is still some discrimination there where as, D you know, men and women work in the same job, I think men get paid more, C but I think that's improving. It's such a slow process it's frustrating, C but, you can see that it's wrong C and you just want to make it right, C but at least the wheels are moving forward. Yeah, I think it's getting better, not worse. D Well, I should probably get back to my job <laughter>. Call again. Okay, byebye.
