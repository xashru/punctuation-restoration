F Uh, D well E I mean I've had time to think about it because, F uh, we've had, F uh, i, i, there's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk to C so. C So, F um, I, I was thinking about a couple things, F uh and whether they are serious. Some things are serious C and some aren't. I guess the biggest thing that bothers me is, is, F uh not the biggest thing, C but one of the things that bothers me is the credit information, F uh, situation, that you, F uh, that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any s, sort of credit, e, extensive checks and, and things of that nature. When, F um, E I, I, I mean I, I don't know if that's an invasion of privacy, simply, I, I do t, I do feel it is C but I don't know whether, some of the questions they ask are legitimate F uh, because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your <laughter>, Uhhuh. D Well I guess, I guess then it's just the big brother concept of the fact, that once you give your social security number there are people I guess who are, who are, F uh, actually collecting all this all the time C and, C and profiles are given. I understand, F uh, I read the other day that, F uh, these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone F uh, all, all they need now is your telephone number, which I guess is involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number or not. I, I, I feel that is an invasion of privacy C but it, Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. My God. Yeah. Yeah, I, I have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me, F uh F uh, D well, by, b, F uh, I make my living by, F uh, flying airplanes for, for a company. C And, F uh, as a, as a, F uh, an airline pilot I have to take random drug testing. E I mean it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time, C so I when I finish a, a certain flight on a random basis I have to, F uh, have a wri, a drug test C and, C and, C and that's without i, F uh, probably cause, C and, F uh, a, C and, in the end now, E I mean they've tested, they've spent forty million dollars C and they've found, F uh, I think, F uh, in pilots anyway, of something like, F uh, F uh, eightysix thousand tests there's only been two guys have come up, F uh, three guys have come up positive, C and one of them was a bad test, C so. Yeah. Yeah. Drug test, righ, Yeah. Yeah, right. Yes, I am. Yeah. Yeah, I, I can understand the public's alarm to it, C but, I guess, having done this all my life, I knew that there wasn't a problem C and, C and it, indeed it has proved out that way, C but now, try to get the damn thing repealed, D you know. I guess I feel bad because, F uh, not only that C but in some of the instances D like you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints, E I mean wha, what, what happens if you say no. If you say no then you're excluded C and I, doesn't seem the courts, Yeah. That's right. It's my feeling also that, that, that although I, I don't know if it's that serious, i, C but that was part of the question, I do feel the courts have, have held up a great deal of, of our privacy, E I mean particularly look in, in some of the, in some of the, F uh, I notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of privacy, which I support of course, C but it I guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that, it does seem that we've, we've slipped and that's eroded, C or at least those in the market place their everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that, D you know, it's fair game, t, you, you have to answer these questions, of course. F Uh, I don't know, I, I feel there has been an erosion C and I don't really know how serious it is, except I don't like it <laughter>. F Um. F Um. Uhhuh. Yeah. What was that? F Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. D Well E I mean it, it, just take that, that step now, where, where now we feel there's a need to do that C and the next thing you know then, F uh, there's always the need to, to go and inspect lockers of high school students, tha, Yeah, I guess so, E I mean D well, F uh, good luck to you, you just moved to Texas <laughter> from Minneapolis. F Uh, I don't, I don't hold out much hope for you. I think they'll be a cultural shock. E I mean I was based there a lot, F uh, several times in the service C and I was absolutely flabbergasted at the, in, in at least in criminal law some of the, some of the, latitudes that the police had, C but. Oh yeah. Yeah. <Laughter>. F Um. F Um. Yeah. D Well, E I mean, I don't understand, if you, if you don't, if they don't make a criminal check, why do you have to be fingerprinted. F Oh, I see, F oh the state doesn't require it. D Well that's kind of, that's rather, that's rather unusual, isn't it. D Well I guess, I guess the extension of that is, why, why not, the next thing you know, we'll just stop a random amount of motorists C and then if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street. F Oh, they do? Yeah. D Well there's, there's all sorts of scare tactics, I guess, to, to invade our privacy C and, Yeah. I just going to say, NINETEEN EIGHTYFOUR, is come an, is come and gone C but it's here. C And the computers, of course helps that. The computer abilities store that information. . F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, D Well what's scary is, F uh, F uh, about two, three, four months ago on a Sun, in the Sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here, The DALLAS MORNING NEWS. They showed a reporter and a, F um, and a copy editor how they went out C and they just took, F um, a fellow in John Q. Public in Dallas C and all they had was, let's see, they had his birth, they had something like his birth date, the street address, F um, they weren't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name, <cough> E excuse me, C and it was, F um, very scary to see what they found out. E I mean they were able to find out what liens he still had against, D you know, two or three houses, through a two divorces, children's names, locations, F um, it was really frightening. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right, uhhuh. I do too, yeah. I don't, the other thing I don't like is, F um, in terms of F uh, D like we just moved here from, F uh, Minneapolis C and, F uh, to get the, the very nice townhouse that we're in, you were required by the property management firm that was representing a private landlo, D you know, husband and wife, owners, F um, who had never done this before. They, F um, asked us for again an astounding amount of information C and what we really didn't have the same opportunity, D you know, C and I guess that's when I also get upset that if you're going to do it then I want to do it too. F Um, in terms of the credit, yeah, I know, F um, we're also going through adoption now, in for an adoption, C and E I mean after we gave our fingerprints n, to the F B I, you, you, look at each other, D yeah, you look at each other and say, D well, <laughter>, it's too late now. F Um, C so E I mean it's, it's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how if they really try, F um. Uhhuh, go ahead. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. it isn't, Positive for anything, D see yeah. D See, F uh, C and I just started working, D well for an electronics firm down here, I used to be a reporter. C And then now, I'm in corporate communications, C and, F uh, part of that <cough> E excuse me, was, as a new hire, that I had to take a drug test, C and I had never been asked that C and I thought, F um, I really didn't like it. F Um, I, I have very mixed feelings about it. I don't disagree or agree with you. F Um, I think i, I think that it's well C and you're in that field, C so I don't know, C but it's, D you know, we lived in, F uh, Minneapolis when the Northwest Airlines pilot in the Dakotas, yeah, that hit the fan like, F uh, you, F uh, you're obviously aware of that, F um <throat_clearing>. I don't know there should be some happy medium in terms of, if they're going to do random, F um, I, I don't agree with random, I guess I would look for a standard in consistency. D You know, in terms of maybe at set intervals, so that everybody knows what's going on, F um, I don't see a problem with that. I do think, I see some level of necessity, F um, <throat_clearing> in something where people are transporting other people, F uh, only because of the things you've heard about. The problem is the reason I feel that way, even to a low degree is because it's the old story the minority make it bad for the, D you know, majority, F um. Yeah, I'm not alarmed. You can't, yeah, I know, it's, F um. Right, right, it's a matter, C and that's, F um, exactly what it is. E I mean, that, that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion. F Um, if we didn't give it we wouldn't go to Romania. E I mean, if, you hate to say that, C but that's the way it is. Uhhuh, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. In terms of the privacy, yeah, that in it, C and also, I agree with that C and in the, in terms of the question, F um, in terms, F uh, I worked in medical public relations for almost a decade, C and that was preAIDS and all the other, F um, things, that were probably there but just not <throat_clearing>, E excuse me, labeled C and I have a real problem with medical professionals, F um, it goes back to the things like drug screening C but if it's in any level even with the potential to endangerment, F um, C and I think this is much stronger than, D you know, pilots or, F uh, train engineers being screened, F um, the transmission of the AIDS virus, F um, i, i, that's a real ethical problem. E I mean I don't, I don't have the answer, E I, I, D you know, I mean I think of the young girl in Florida who, D well, yeah that's, was she from your part of the country? C Or was she from, The young girl that, F uh, contracted AIDS through her dentist, allegedly. C And then they proved it, yeah. I don't, I don't know, F um, i, y, I don't know if it's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general, or what, F um, Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, the, I guess the question is, F uh, the, the thing for me is, who sets the parameters or who has the control, D you know. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. F Oh it's, it's ter, I'm, F uh, very seriously, no, more than just seriously, I'm more than likely going to be going to law school in the Fall. C And, yeah, if I figure out that's still what I really want to do C and, th, the things I'm finding out are the <throat_clearing> in terms of things D like privacy, the way the law is interpreted, presented, F um, it's no better than journalism <laughter>. F Um, except in journalism it's words, F um, this is very frightening in that, F uh, F oh, C and in, F uh, in Texas they, they d, they do not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents, whether it's domestic or international, they're one of only five states that do not require a criminal investigation check. Yet, if you're caught with, let's just say, F um, that somebody who's in ne, not us, C but somebody who's need of carting, F um, aluminum beer cans around, they haven't touched them, they haven't drank them, they picked them up off the street C and they want to take them to a recycling, F uh, resource for money, or whatever. F Um, they've, they've been going through a lot of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again, F um, because they've been arresting people like that. D You know. C Because, F um, in our case, one is at the state and the other one is at the federal level. Because you have to de, because you have to deal with the I N, yeah, because you have to deal with the, F uh, imi, immigration service. Yeah it is, it's, F uh, the whole thing is, E I mean there's, again there's no consistency. D You know, D like in your, in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly, F um, I can't see why after a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they can't do it at an interval, C or D you know, E I mean , They, they do that in Texas. <Laughter> They don't do it for drugs, what they do is they check to see if you've got, F uh, current insurance C or they check to, to see if you're permits are, Yeah, I know C and it's kind of, F um, what's the word I want, I don't, it's ju, to me it's just frightening, D you know. E I mean the old, F uh, I'm old enough now where George Orwell, F uh, way past time <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, it's exactly true, E I mean I, D Well look at what we're talking now, E I mean, it's, look how we're talking now, E I mean you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger, D you know,
