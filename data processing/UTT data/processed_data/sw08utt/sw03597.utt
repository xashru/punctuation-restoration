do you see as, F uh, the changes that have occurred in the last, Beverly. Huh, yeah, that's a big one. D Well, I think that society has come to a point where they're not responsible for any of their actions. Somebody else, F uh, made them do it. F Uh, that's what I seem to see a lot of, that, F uh, no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices. It's rather, sue these guys because they made a foo, F uh, a seat belt that didn't work right C or F uh, that's what I think is a big one. Uhhuh. Sure. Yeah, C and, another thing I think has changed quite a bit is, F uh, the roles that men and women play. That's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly. D Well, both, D you know, there's some great things that, F uh, have come about with more equality, C but I think that also, I don't know what's causing society to have so many broken families and things like that, because I think that's bad for us. Uhhuh. Yeah, I would agree with you. F Uh, I think one of the thing that I notice a lot, I know it's touching social changes, C but, F uh, to me what becomes socially acceptable, C and I, I don't know if it's a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if it's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction, C but I notice things on T V being more, F um, open, more I believe, F uh, they portray things on T V obviously that they never would have years ago, C and, D you know, C and specifically, nudity, things like that, F uh, I don't know, I, I've said several times to my husband that I feel like gee, in ten years they'll have just full nudity on T V C and nobody will think anything of it, C and to me that's surprising. To me, that's, that's a big change to accept it, C and it comes across, I think subtly, D you know, a little at a time, to where you get so used to seeing a little change, that, D you know, when they go one step further, you don't notice it that much. That's one of the biggest ones I've seen. What about you? Uhhuh. I tend to agree with you, C and I think there's a lot of that. F Um, yeah, we have become lawsuit happy. Any little thing, it's like let's see what I can get. Don't you think that maybe a lot of that came from, F um, F oh, D you know, the, the, the era we went through that was like, D you know, hey if it makes you happy, do it. D You know, kind of like, disregard to others, do what makes you happy, C and, C and yes, we should take care of ourselves, D you know, C and we should see to our own lives, but not to a total disregard of others. F Um, I don't know, I think it's come to that a lot. I see it a lot in my daughter. I have a four year old. C And hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through, C but whenever something happens it's, you made me hit that, you made me do this, C and so I try to tell her,, everything isn't always somebody else's fault. D You know, you have to watch where you're going <laughter>, C and C and so it's what you just said, kind of hits home to me, just through her. C So. I think you're right. F Um, in your opinion, good or bad, or both? I do too. I think part of that, I don't know, I think the role of women changing has been good in that women are feeling D like, in terms of their self confid, confidence, their self worth, D you know, I can do something, I can be somebody, D you know, if I put my mind to it, I can accomplish things too. C And I think that's good, C but, F um, I think when you push, D you know, maybe I think when that was first trying come about with, D you know, what we know as the women's lib movement I think it was too extreme. F Um, I think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too, D you know, C and I think there's definite roles, C and I think, D you know, part of the break up of the family, maybe it's because of the, the, the social changes, I don't know, the fact that, F uh, during their early changes where, D you know, women did come more, speak, maybe speak out, A I was going to say, come more out of themselves, C but speak out, I think a lot of men were threatened by that. I think now less men are, D you know, because they're used to it, it's around them. F Um, C but I, I don't know, I, I, I don't know why the families are breaking up. I think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about people not being responsible for themselves or their actions, because it's like they don't go into the marriage with a commitment that this is going to work. They go in and say, D well, hey, D you know, I'll stick with it while it's good, C and then I'll get out. C And I, I, I think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment.
