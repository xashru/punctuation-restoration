Do you have any particular thoughts about the school system? <Laughter>. I say agree with you a hundred percent there <laughter>. Yeah. <Sniffing>. Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting C because, F uh, we're just having conversation on this, F uh, with a couple of people yesterday. C And I was expressing my frustrations that, F uh, some of the, so many problems, A I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a, a degree of selfdiscipline which may be reflected in society at large. F Uh, C and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, F uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. F Um, C and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem C and <laughter> I'll say, they'll say, F oh, D well, our kids, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. C And, C and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk, C and, D you know, we do check with other teachers, C and other teachers find the same things in this child. C And, D you know, how do you tell your parent's, the parent, hey, wake up, and smell the coffee <laughter>. C But, F um, it, it is a problem, C and I'm not sure <lipsmack> just, F uh, how, how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it. Whether maybe through a commitment of the P T A, F uh, and the parents being informed better, that in fact that the problems that are nationwide are problems, F um, of society, and that, that the school can only do so much on it. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. That's right. Uhhuh. <Noise> <Noise> <<like water running>> You know what scares me too, is that we have yet to see other, the biggest effect of the crack children F uh, in the school system. These are children that are born with low deficit, attention deficit C and, gosh, what's going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system. That's really scary <Noise> <<like water running>>. C But there are, I think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve, C and this is something that I see. <Breathing> Too many times students <sigh> get diagnosed as mo, slow learners, C and in fact they're not. They're behavior problems. C And so, they get put in, in, in our school system, in a class that's limited for skills children that have, really have to master skills. C And that's not their problem. F Um, at the same time, I've seen, we, we have a, an international population. There's no bridge area for students coming out of the E S O L, which is English for Speakers of Other Languages program. The, once they're past E S O L, they get out, they got thrown right into the total mainstream <Lipsmack> C and, F uh, there really needs to be a bridge, some sort of transition for that. C So the school systems can improve, both in standing up for splitting classes, D you know, having learning dis, learning, slow, slow children in slow classes, but not mixing them with behavior problems. C And then, D you know, the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes, you get these kids that are average students but highly motivated. C And then you throw in kids that are not motivated, maybe bright, but they're discipline problems. C And you sometimes the average classes really are problems because you've got such a mixed bag there. D You know, the gifted and talented are fast classes. There's really not that much of a problem with. C But it's, Uhhuh. That's, yeah. I remember I had a college professor who once said that genius is one percent inspiration, and ninetynine percent perspiration. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I guess kids do mature at different ages too. That's, C and, D you know, as a teacher you, you try to make, be understanding that, D you know, there are different ages, kids are, is this a, got a kid that just a question of maturity, C or is he a problem child. C But teachers are asked to diagnose so much. F Um, there, E I mean, E I mean we're, have to be, we're alerted there's all sorts of systems where suicide, F uh, predisposition. E I mean, we're alerted to what the moment we see something. If we see a child that we have any reason, that's on drugs, such as if he's got a beeper or if they're, if they're flashing lots of money around. We've, there are certain things to do. E I mean, C so tea, the school system's asked to do so much, C but you can't operate in a vacuum. This is a, we're in a rather wealthy suburb of Washington. C And a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the, F uh, principal. It's for drug use. They can't imagine for anything else. Yeah. D You know, it's, it's amazing, C but F uh, you get all sorts, you get all, all sorts of things, F uh, in the schools, F uh, F uh, C and it's, C and D you know, as a teacher you're alert, you're alert for the kid who's very drowsy. You're alert to the kid who suddenly has a, F um, behavioral change, C and you refer them to the nurse. C And, so, E I mean, you have to find out whether there's a legitimate reason, <laughter> or whether this is a warning signal. C And parents frequently resent when you ask them. Is there a problem that we should be aware of? Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, the denial mechanism is really strong C and so many parents are facilitators. E I mean, they're manipulated by their children. I've been fortunate. I have, F uh, a son who's a sophomore in college up in Massachusetts at, F uh, Amherst, C and my other son is a senior in high school, C and he's going on to Williams. C And E I mean, they're really super. They're both national level swimmers, C and where we've been very fortunate, C but, D you know, they had to be held accountable too. E I mean, D you know, at some point a parent does help their kid, but in, in some ways, C but, C but you have to say at what point isn't the help becoming negative. C And I think this is where the school system at, is suffering, and not through any fault of the effort of the school system. C But gee it was good talking with you. Yeah, C so there are people throughout the country that feel the same ways that you do, and, and are connected with the schools. Uhhuh. D Well, we are, though <laughter>. Listen, good luck. Take care, Byebye. <Noise> <<TV or radio>> D Well, F um, <<pause>> I, <<pause>> I think that in, in, F uh, recently with the, I'm not sure if it's more a problem with American families or a problem with the school system. They seem to be burdening the school system more and more with problems, any problems that a child might have, whether it's actually a school related thing or not C and, I. Yeah, C and, C and, D well, it's gotten to a point where the schools are expected to take care of everything. If, F uh, you've some kid who doesn't have, F uh, who's from a broken family, the schools are supposed to fill that void. It's gotten way beyond teaching, F uh, D you know, teaching classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like, F oh, were kind of traditionally the school's roles. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, then, then again when you have, F uh, a society where a certain percentage of the parents are, F uh, doing drugs in the home F uh, either unemployed and don't care about a, F uh, just a have their own problems how, how do you expect the school to, F um, E or how do you expect the, you can't really expect that parent who's, quite frankly a loser in life, as it is to, to care about the, the situation with their child, C and, Right. Right. Yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Right. D Well, I, I've seen more, F uh, incredibly intelligent underachievers than, than, F uh, I personally I will, I would take a person who's motivated and a little, F uh, less intelligent than the person who, F uh, is one of these very intelligent people who just kind of, isn't motivated to do anything. Yeah. D Well, I, not to toot my own horn here or anything, but I, I was graduated from my high school, I was the valedictorian, C and I know that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me, C and they proved out late when it came time to take the S A T s. Mine were good, C but they weren't great. C And, F uh, when I got into college I struggled, I struggled just to, F uh, get my degree in the, in the field that I was in. Whereas I knew people that in high school were kind of lazy and all, C but they got motivated in college C and they did a lot better than I did. C And when it, Right. Uhhuh. Right. You actually have students with, with beepers? Uhhuh. E I mean, where, what are the, what could they possibly be thinking. E I mean how. Yeah <Laughter>. Right. Yeah, can you, how can you, <laughter> how can you expect to, Oh yeah, I, I, I was, F uh, sitting in the barber shop. I'm an officer in the Air Force, C and I was having my hair cut C and the barber got a call while I was there, F uh, from his son's school. His son's in high school. C And his son was failing gym and, F uh, and having trouble, with a few other things. C But, D you know, it's like, F uh, this guy was like, why D now, there's no problem with my kid. My kid's a great kid and all this. The kid had missed all these classes, C and basically he, his answer was, F Oh, I gave him permission to, to miss. Yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Sure. Right. Sure. Right. It was good talking to you too. Yeah. Yeah, I've had interesting conversations on several subjects not, F uh, not just this but different, the different things. It's amazing how the, D you know, people you talk to have some interesting conversations C and, F uh, it's too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown into a data base, and that none of the ideas or thoughts are being used at all <laughter>. Yeah, that's true. Yep. Byebye.
