Have you ever gotten one of those calls that is either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list C and their either offering a service C or they're introducing some new product in the area C and normally when they call, you're either in the shower, C or you're in the middle of cooking something C and you have to stop everything to run to the phone. That was the big one I'm talking about. I work weird hours, C and invariably just about the time, I'm going to sleep, the phone tears off the wall. C And you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone, you either hear, the cli, as soon as you say hello, you hear the click of the recording coming on, C or you hear somebody all ready starting, reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already. I've even had some of them, the, they're voice activated C and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything. What I would love to see done to stop all of this, we've got a thing in this country, you can have your phone number unlisted, C and I think a law should be passed to where any of these people, I think it's great, that D you know, freedom of speech in this country and everything, C but if they're going to offer these services, or these recorded message, everything, they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them. That's about, that as far as any other everyday occurrences, I put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door, either religious groups, or people peddling products. If I wanted their products, I would have either gone to the store to bought it, C or I would have called for their salesman to come out. D Now, I agree with their right to, F uh, <TV> pursue their religion of choice, in that, whatever manner they want to, C but I think they should also respect the sanctity of the American home, whether it be in a house or in an apartment. I'm on my turf, if I want them there, I'll call for them, otherwise, I don't want to know they exist. D Now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting, I've even gone so far as to put that, I've got a storm door on the front of the house C and I've put, in, I don't know how much clearer it can be, it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting. I should have, I guess I should make another one that says religious or otherwise, cause I still get, I wonder if there would be some way we could get these people to do this get their names, their addresses, and their phone numbers C and then reverse it, C and do, D well that would be technically illegal, it would be harassment. C But, I consider an invasion of my privacy, a harassment in itself. I believe we've pretty much summed everything up. I'm drawing a blank. F Uh, pretty close to it. D Well I've enjoyed talking with you. C And take it easy now. Good night. Yes, yes. Is, is that one that you're talking about. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's true, or the ones that are, are generated by a computer. It's just a computer voice that comes on the line. Those are the ones that I really, really hate too. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, sometimes I, I get them on my, F uh, answering machine at home C so, C and I hate that when I've got a whole bunch of messages C and I go through them C and most of them aren't from anybody at all. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, yes, D see I have an unlisted telephone number, C but I still get all of those calls C and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I don't even understand. C So, yeah, I do, I really feel that's, F uh, an invasion of my privacy. I agree with you on that particular subject there. Let me see. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, that's true. Living in an apartment complex though, D you know you can't, F um, you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations, F uh, C but they still come up to the front door and, F uh, D you know, walk around. C So, usually what I do is I'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey, there's people coming around, D you know, C and they're trying to sell something C or, C or they're from a religious organization C and I really hate that. I really, really do. I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago C and, F uh, gosh it was about nine o'clock at night, too. It wasn't even what I would consider, D you know, family hours, time to, D you know, start going to bed C and F uh, C and it was somebody from, F um, oh what was it, the, F uh, Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, C and F uh, I've read a lot about, F uh, that particular sect C and I don't particularly care for it, C so I especially don't like for them to come up to my door and, and try and talk to me. Yeah, yeah, no, I, I agree with you there. If they want to choose that particular religion that's fine with me too, D you know, as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in. C And, C and I don't like the way that they do it either, C and, C and, it's their mission that they do it. They go door to door C and they go out into the public C and they actually have the, F uh, teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work C and, F uh, I don't know, I just, F um, don't particularly care for that at all. C And that, that's one thing that I feel really strongly about though, is, F uh, D you know, people coming up to my door, and especially religious organizations and wanting to F uh, D you know, to try and get me to join or, D you know, become interested in their religion, C because I have my own. <Laughter> Yeah, yeah, that's true, yeah. No I don't, F uh, I don't have, I didn't go that far C but, F uh, yeah I probably could do the same thing, F uh, D you know, I don't have a storm door, C but I'm sure I could rig up something. C But D you know I don't think that that would stop people. I, it's like they see that word C and it says go <laughter>, instead of stop. F Oh, goodness. <Laughter> F Oh gosh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true, that's true, F um. D Well what else? I know, C but I remember you, you talked about something, you started off and said, D well let me think, you talked about the telephone calls and people coming and soliciting and selling things at the door. You said something else. I can't remember what it was, C and I thought yeah, that, that kind of touched a nerve right there, C but we got F uh, we got to talking about the, F uh, F uh, people coming to you at the front door. <Laughter> F Oh goodness, okay, is our five minutes up? Pretty close. D Well it was nice talking to you too Jim. Okay, thanks, bye.
