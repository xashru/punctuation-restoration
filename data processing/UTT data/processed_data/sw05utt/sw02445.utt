I don't know, F um, do you do a lot of camping? Yeah. F Oh, C so, Yeah, F um, up here some of the state parks are really nice C and some of them aren't, some of them are pretty rough. F Um, yeah, they, they just have D like outhouses, they don't have D like a shower room or anything, yeah, C but some of them are really nice they have showers and full bathrooms, F um, C but I don't know, I, I've been camping a couple times C but I'm not a real avid camper, F uh, a lot of people I know are, C but, F um, I don't, I don't. Yeah, we went, we went once to a leanto C and it, F um, E I mean, there wasn't any electricity on the camp site C but it was all right, we only spent two nights there. I wouldn't want to spend more than two nights. I wouldn't want to go for D like a week, C but, F um, two nights is good. F Um, especially there was a little store close by, C so, it was pretty nice. F Oh, really? Oh. F Um, yeah, up here you got to wait until, Aug, August, until the water warms up. D Well, it's not that bad C but it's still pretty chilly. F Um, I don't know, I was, I have a tent C and I fluff out in it, in the backyard and stuff, C but this thing about camping that bothers me is you've got to pack everything C and another thing is the thing seems to get, it's dirty <laughter> D you know, C so, you can't keep the dirt out of the tent. I don't know we have a seven year old, it's pretty funny, D like stay out. Yeah, boy, he doesn't go in and out of the tent a hundred times. And use it as a play, F uh, they like to play in them. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, D well, what we were doing, we were just going to say, we're just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night, so, D you know, no going in and out, and, or what he wants to do, we had brought his friend along, was play in the tent. It was like, no, this is not working, <laughter>, you can't do that, you get the tent all dirty. C Plus you get it all wet, we were at a beach site, too. No, C but, D you know, I was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because they are really nice C and, F um, up here we have, F uh, we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime. They're terrible, they're really terrible. F Uh, C but, there's this one campsite, that it, just some of them are known C but there is one that's out in this big lake C and it's, it's, it's, mosquitoes are terrible C and then there's this, there's this other one that's more up in the mountains C but it surrounds a manmade reservoir C and there's no bugs, that's the whole thing that everyone told me, F oh, I'm, I was going to go to, Lit, Little River State Park, that place is great, there's no bugs. C But, F oh, okay, C because, F uh, we were having a really big problem up here in certain areas, we were really affected bad by it, but really got it, F um, almost destroyed the ch, the tourism in one town, because of the mosquitoes, they're so, bad. Yeah, that was, it's a really nice area, I've been there before C and it's, I, I couldn't imagine ge, living just sixty miles north of them C but they were plagued, they were plagued with them, with mosquitoes. C And you can go out, outside in the daytime, all right, C but the minute the sun went down, F um, A that's when it's usually, the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out. E I mean, just the very second, it's really strange. They, F uh, they must, F uh, work on that, D you know, the, i, it gets cooler when the sun sets C and then they all come out. F Oh, yeah, yeah, I never really noticed how effective they were, C but, F um, because that wasn't really, I bought them, I really didn't get to use them like, F oh, there's mosquitoes let's turn them. We just sort of lit them. C And, F um, we weren't bothered that much by mosquitoes, C so, we didn't really contribute it to that. C But, F um, I think in an area that's really thick with mosquitoes, I can't see all this little, F uh, smoke buckets I call them, they work, C but they're suppose to work really well. F Oh, I'm in my paperwork here, that's what I do when I wait for a phone call, I get in my paperwork <laughter>. F Oh, to find my most important parts. C But I don't know, I don't know if I'm going to go, I wish was an avid camper C and I could really talk about like gardening or something, you can talk about that a lot, C but, F um, I do want to go again. We just moved to a new hou, into a house, C so, I don't think camping, maybe in the backyard, C but I don't see going on a camping trip probably until next summer. C So, it's easy for you to go. F Um, F oh, God <<very faint>>. I don't know C but that sounds that my, my kind of camping, it really does. Yeah, okay, F um, D well, F um, that is is to have a, a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it, plus your tent. Yep. F Um, D Well, those, they're kind of nice C but they're also, F um, flimsy when you really look at them. C But when you get inside they're really nice, D you know, everything's really, C but then when you look underneath them, it's just got these little wheels and this little axle, it's like, F oh, my C and then a big windstorm it would pick you up. F Oh, jeez, yeah, what do you, what do you do when you get a, E I mean, D like a really violent storm like a tornado, just stay in your truck. E I mean, I wouldn't stay in the, F um, Oh. D So, then, were they successful? C But it took them a little while? Yeah, D so, did they get stuck? Yeah, F huh. D Well, C so, they evacuated it <laughter>. Wow. Yeah. I know I always I like to get right on the water, yeah, by the campsite, it's so, we have leantos up here. I really like them, like I say, they're kind of, just kind of more sturdy than anything, D you know, just, just, Yeah, they're, they're leantos. They're, F um, D Yeah, they're pretty nice, they're, they're, F uh, it's like a little house except the whole face is open, C and the one time that we went, we got one, it was overlooking the water C but it was a big embankment, I wanted to get one right on the water. we had an electrical storm too, C and it was really, it was neat sitting there watching it, E I mean, it was raining, when we called home, everybody said, F oh, we were worried about you in that storm... D Well, my husband and I haven't done a whole lot of camping, we, C but we bought a van last year, C and we were hoping, F uh, to do some camping in the van, F um, we did go camping in Arkans, not Arkansas, Oklahoma. F Uh, last year in, we camped in a tent, C and, F uh, there were two other couples with us C and there was, F uh, state park. C And it was really nice. Really? F Um. I, I don't like really camping in the rough. I like the, the, the little necessities like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that. Yeah, that would, that would be much. Yeah, the campsite that we went to was an area that, it's right on a big lake, C and there's a lot of boating out there, C and we, we went up there to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit C but it was still, F uh, it was still, too, cold. Yeah, it, it was pretty early in the year. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we, we have, we have a dog C and that's just about as bad as a kid <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, I don't know how you can really keep, F uh, the inside of a tent clean. Other than, D you know, taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and, and sweeping it out everyday, it's really hard to, to keep the sand and dirt out of it. Did, Uhhuh. F Um, did you have another, a big tent, like F uh, F um, like a, looks like a sitting area type, D you know, like a two room type? Yeah, yeah, we don't really have a problem with that, F um, in these areas, F um, C and even, even when in Oklahoma when we camped I really didn't notice a problem with bugs. C And I noticed that, I know that I said, that's, I've, I've lived back east before, F um, they, F Huh. Really? F Huh. D Well, have you ever, have you ever taken any of those, F um, what do they call this, lights, have you ever used those? Uhhuh. Yeah. F Huh. Uhhuh. Yeah, I'd, I'd like to go camping crosscountry, F um, I just got married less than two years ago, C so, we don't have any, any children yet, F um, Yeah, C so, easy to pick up and go, and, s, we have a van C and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it. D So, it's not really, I guess, camping the way peop, most people picture camping in the tent C but, Yeah, C or, C or get, my brother has a real nice popup. C And he just, he just tows it behind his truck. C And he, he's got three kids, C so, his kids will sleep in the truck, in the, in the back of the bed. F Um, C and they sleep in the popup. Yeah. Yeah, he did have a problem, F uh, when he went camping last year in Beavers Bend, Ok, Oklahoma, F um, a, a storm came in C and it started raining really heavy C and they were all, everybody was trying to flee the campsite, <laughter>, everybody was getting stuck in the mud. C And, F uh, D Well, theirs was so bad, C and they were so close to the water that the water was coming up, C and they had to get out of there. Yeah, they, D yeah, they were. C But, yeah, they <laughter> they decided that, that was enough camping for the weekend. No, they ended up getting out. They ended up helping several other people though that were, that were stuck. Yeah, yeah, they, the whole, the whole campsite was evacuated. E I mean some, I think some people that had fairly sturdy, F um, vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water, I think they stayed. C But everybody that was real close to the water ended up, it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream. Yeah. They have them right at the campsites? Wow.
